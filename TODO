Split out libcd (+libcdupnp) from libimport, find better name for what's left?
Writable db::local
Writable db::upnp
If Queue'd URLs refer to localhost, rewrite ITO IP as seen by target
MultiStream could be a LOT simpler now, see tv::dvb::Service::CountedStream
Pool http::Clients
Let util::http::ContentFactory return *either* Stream or SeekableStream
  (receiverd::ContentFactory knows which 'cos of type==radio)

libreceiverd: split RCF into separate content-factories
libutil: boost::asio instead of class Socket? (no, can't use ui::qt::Scheduler)
libutil: bind.h instead of Task::Run/OnActivity/OnTimer?
How much Boost do we lose out on if we insist on -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions?
new empeg receiver distribution (freetype, ...)
Turn Stream/SeekableStream into BufferPtr factories?
