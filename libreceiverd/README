        Rio Receiver and Chorale
        ------------------------

Chorale includes a server for the networking protocol used by the Rio
Receiver[1] music player.

For use with Empeg Car, Receiver Edition[2], that is all you need; the
Receiver Edition boots from its own hard drives. Likewise for
Chorale's own Receiver-protocol client.

For use with real Rio Receiver devices (and/or Dell Digital Audio
Receivers, which are the same thing rebranded), you will additionally
need a network-boot setup and a set of layout files (see below).


Network-boot setup, Windows
---------------------------

The Windows application which comes on the Rio Receiver CD, "Audio
Receiver Manager", contains a suitable network-boot server. If you
don't still have your CD, a copy of ARMgr can be downloaded from:

http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/support/rio/product.asp?prodID=99&locSup=USA

(At time of writing, April 2008, it still can! which is frankly
admirable on D&M's part for a product discontinued in 2003.)

You should install Audio Receiver Manager before installing Chorale,
but -- as Receivers can only work with one server at a time -- you
should then *disable* (not uninstall) Audio Receiver Manager by removing
it from the Start->Programs->Startup menu.

Chorale for Windows reads the registry entries left by Audio Receiver
Manager, in order to find the firmware files -- hence there is no
equivalent of Linux choraled's "-w" or "--arf" options.


Network-boot setup, Linux or similar
------------------------------------

Again, the only legal way to obtain the file "receiver.arf" is to find
a Windows PC and install the original Windows server software on it,
see above. In a default install, the file will be at

	C:\Program Files\Audio Receiver\receiver.arf

You should copy this file to $(PREFIX)/share/chorale on your Linux
server. So, if you install Chorale with prefix /usr, the full path
should be /usr/share/chorale/receiver.arf.

If you install it elsewhere, you can tell choraled about it with the
option "--arf=PATHNAME".

Alternatively, Chorale also supports booting Receivers using "real"
NFS diskless booting; setting that up is too complex to explain here
but a guide is at:

        http://jreceiver.sourceforge.net/rio/jrec-install-rio.html

That guide is aimed at setting up an alternative server, J-Receiver,
but most of the information is generic. Follow the steps down to, and
including, "NFS Server Test".

Another, much terser, guide is here:

        http://www.mock.com/receiver/server/

If you set up NFS network booting, you should start choraled with the
option "--nfs=<ip-address-of-boot-server>".


Network-boot setup, Rio Central
-------------------------------

Srsly? I mean, I think fewer than 300 Rio Centrals were ever made. But
in the unlikely even that you have one, you can use it as your
network-boot server in the same way described above for Windows
servers. Turn off its music server.


Layout files
------------

For some reason, Rio Receivers store their screen layouts as files on
the music server, and don't have any built-in fallback. So you need to
find the "Layout" directory in a Windows installation of Audio
Receiver Manager -- in a default install, it will be
	C:\Program Files\Audio Receiver\Layout
-- and copy it to $(PREFIX)/share/chorale/layout on your music
server. So, if you install Chorale with prefix /usr, you should have
files such as /usr/share/chorale/layout/en_UK/big_title.

The symptom of getting this wrong, is that the menus all work on the
Receiver, but nothing appears on the display once playback starts.

    They can be had very cheaply from Ebay and the like; the screen is
    really their weak point, as it's quite small and hard-to-read by
    modern standards, but the audio quality is very good.

    Version 3 alpha 8 was the first release of the Receiver Edition, so
    that's where the explanation is fullest; you shouldn't actually use
    that version, though, as many bugs were fixed by the time of alpha 11:
