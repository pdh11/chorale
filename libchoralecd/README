choralecd
=========

Simple CD ripping program for Chorale.

Knows about single-artist, compilation, and continuous-mix albums.

One ripping thread per CD mech, one (low-priority) encoding thread per
CPU.

Encodes to MP3 and FLAC simultaneously (starting as soon as the first
sector is ripped).

Can rip a second CD as soon as the first finishes ripping (i.e., while
still encoding the first one).
