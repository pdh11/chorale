The licensing of Chorale is a little unusual, as it is intended to
honour fully the requirements placed on certain elements of it by the
GPL and LGPL, while leaving the rest of it -- the parts with no such
requirements -- available for reuse in any other software, even
proprietary software, with or without attribution.

Some configuration scripts in the "autotools" directory are derived
works of the Autoconf Macro Archive (at
http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to), though all use the AllPermissive
licence.

The remaining source code, i.e. everything not in the "autotools"
directory, is hereby released by its author or authors into the public
domain, and all copyright is disclaimed.

Some sections of source code in the "choralecd" directory are, in
part, derived works of example code supplied with Qt3. Unlike Qt
itself, the example code is not licensed under the GPL:
qfileiconview.cpp, for instance, says "This example program may be
used, distributed and modified without limitation".

Binaries compiled from the "choralecd" directory link against Qt, and
must thus be distributed under the licence under which you obtained
Qt: typically, this will be the GNU General Public Licence, found in
the file COPYING.GPL. Get proper legal advice if unsure.

Other binaries compiled from this source code, including the daemon
"choraled", typically link with libraries (including, at least,
libxml++ and Taglib) which are licensed under the GNU Library General
Public Licence, found in the file COPYING.LGPL. Such binaries are
therefore "works that use the Library" as per Section 5 of the LGPL,
and you must not redistribute them without complying with the
requirements of Section 6. Get proper legal advice if unsure.
