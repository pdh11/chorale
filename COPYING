The licensing of Chorale is a little unusual, as it is intended to
honour fully the requirements placed on certain elements of it by the
GPL and LGPL, while leaving the rest of it -- the parts with no such
requirements -- available for reuse in any other software, even
proprietary software, with or without attribution.

Some configuration scripts in the "autotools" directory are derived
works of the Autoconf Macro Archive (at
http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to), though all use the AllPermissive
licence.

The remaining source code, i.e. everything not in the "autotools"
directory, is hereby released by its author or authors into the public
domain, and all copyright is disclaimed.

Some sections of source code in the "choralecd" directory are, in
part, derived works of example code supplied with Qt3. Unlike Qt
itself, the example code is not licensed under the GPL:
qfileiconview.cpp, for instance, says "This example program may be
used, distributed and modified without limitation".

Binaries compiled from the "choralecd" directory link against Qt, and
must thus be distributed under the licence under which you obtained
Qt: typically, this will be the GNU General Public Licence version 3,
found in the file COPYING.GPL. If, at configure time, cdparanoia is
not detected but libcdio is, libcdio (also under the GPLv3) will also
be linked. Get proper legal advice if unsure.

Other binaries compiled from this source code, including the daemon
"choraled", also link with libcdio if present (and if cdparanoia isn't
found), and thus in that case must also be distributed under
GPLv3. Even if libcdio is not used, they typically also link with
libraries (including, at least, Taglib) which are licensed under the
GNU Library General Public Licence, found in the file
COPYING.LGPL. Such binaries are therefore "works that use the Library"
as per Section 5 of the LGPL, and you must not redistribute them
without complying with the requirements of Section 6. Get proper legal
advice if unsure.

You can use the configure options --without-gpl or --without-lgpl to
ignore GPL and GPL/LGPL libraries respectively, but this is no
substitute for carefully checking licences yourself if you intend to
release LGPL or closed-source derived works of Chorale. If you don't
mind distributing your derived work under GPLv3, you can of course
just go ahead and enable everything.
